## 0.1 Ordered sets

**Definition 1.**  
A **binary relation** \( R \) between two sets \( M \) and \( N \) is a set of pairs \( (m, n) \) with \( m \in M \) and \( n \in N \),  
i.e., a subset of the set \( M \times N \) of all such pairs.  

Instead of \( (m, n) \in R \), we often write \( m \, R \, n \).  
If \( N = M \), we speak of a **binary relation on the set** \( M \).  

\( R^{-1} \) denotes the **inverse relation** to \( R \),  
that is, the relation between \( N \) and \( M \) with  
\( n \, R^{-1} \, m \iff m \, R \, n. \)
